# Database

The database(s) is where all collected information will be stored, that includes sensor data, MCU MAC-addresses, login information, and anything else you can think of. This data can then be used to plot graphs, check for device/user identification, and everything else.

This task involves deciding on the best paradigms (systems) to store appropriate data (SQL, NoSQL, CQL, GraphQL), learn to use cloud database service (Firebase, MongoDB, MySQL), decide when it's best to store remotely or locally, when to send/backup data to a remote database, design database schemas (structures), as well as integrating it to work smoothly with the back-end (server) and the front-end (client).
