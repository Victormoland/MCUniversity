Hardware part is about working with the physical layer of the project - programming, wiring, and interconnecting MCUs (ESP32, Arduinos, others) and eventually, the Zumo car drone(s). The MCUs have to work with various sensors and actuators, and be able to transmit the recorded data to the server (using Websockets), as well as be controllable from Web- and Mobile Clients.

Involves both low-level (for getting UIDs and MAC-addresses) and high-level C++ programming, as well as tinkering with hardware - finding best peripheral (sensor/actuator) configurations, wiring MCUs together with peripherals, understanding and programming various sensors and actuators, MCU/Zumo pinout analysis, maybe small amount of soldering.
