Data handling involves creating scripts (preferably in C++ or Python) to preprocess, process and in general, standardize various information to most efeective data structures, so that they can be further used in data visualization (plotting, graphing, analysis, etc.), database storage (Firebase, SQL, NoSQL, CQL, GraphQL, etc.), Websocket communications (node comms i.e. server <-> client, server <-> hardware, etc.) and more.

The APIs have to methodize data so that it requires minimal to none processing in other system modules and do it in effective fashion as to limit processing time as much as possible, as well as be fairly readable, customizable and debuggable.

Involves mostly coding - data structures, processing functions/methods etc.
